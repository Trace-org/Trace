# Trace: Benevity for the People, Powered by Stellar

## üí° Inspiration

Trace is inspired by platforms like Benevity, but with a crucial difference: it leverages the power of the Stellar blockchain for safer, faster, and more transparent transactions. Our goal is to make social impact initiatives accessible not only to companies but also to the common person, fostering a more direct and trustworthy connection between donors and projects.

## ‚ú® Features

Trace offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance transparency and engagement in social impact projects:

*   **Home Project List:** Explore a curated list of social impact projects, each with detailed information.
*   **Project Details & Transparency:** Dive deep into individual projects, track their progress through milestones, and view real-time updates (including photos and videos) directly from the NGOs or project organizers. This ensures donors can verify how their contributions are being utilized.
*   **Company Dashboard:** For corporate users, a dedicated dashboard provides insightful social impact statistics, tools for budgeting donations, and easy access to tax deduction reports.
*   **Secure & Fast Transactions:** All transactions and project data are securely stored and managed using Stellar with Soroban contracts, ensuring trustless and efficient operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js**: For running the frontend application.
*   **Rust**: For compiling and interacting with the Soroban contracts.
*   **Stellar CLI**: For deploying and interacting with Soroban contracts.

### Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` if you prefer)
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Contracts Setup
1.  Navigate to the `contracts` directory: `cd contracts`
2.  Install Rust toolchain (if not already installed): `rustup install stable`
3.  Compile the contracts:
    ```bash
    cd marketplace
    cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
    ```
    The compiled artifact will be located at `contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release/marketplace.wasm`.
4.  Optimize the WASM (recommended for production):
    ```bash
    stellar contract optimize --wasm ../target/wasm32v1-none/release/marketplace.wasm
    ```

## üìñ Usage

Once the frontend is running, you can:
*   Browse various social impact projects on the home page.
